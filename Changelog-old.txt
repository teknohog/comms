30.11.2003:
Added command_play_album contributed by Kim Poulsen <kpo()daimi.au.dk>

30.12.2003:
Changed backend into pyxmms
(http://www.via.ecp.fr/~flo/2002/PyXMMS/xmms.html)

26.08.2005: Added command_add_cd and command_play_cd

28.9.2005: Improved xmms launching. If an X server is running, it is utilized.

8.12.2005:
Disabed move during playback (see function command_move for reasons)
Re-enabled mark_all
Added mplayer-style 9/0 keybindings for volume down/up
Moved audio CD functions from playlist to root window

20060106:
Disabled periodic display updates while paused (to facilitate the following)
Added display_fileinfo. It has some problems still:
* when path is too long -- use larger terminal window if possible
* when song is playing -- pause the song to see the path

20060329:
Added the rather experimental command_add_via_cache. It copies a file
to a cache directory, and adds that copy into playlist. I wrote it to
help with DJing, so that I can make a playlist of files that are
burned on different CDs.
It could use a feature to remove files from cache after they have been
played, but it's not essential for me at the moment. A single night's
cache should not take too many gigs.

20060615:
Kind of bugfix in command_add_cd and command_play_cd

20060829:
command_mark_all: removed dupe and changed behaviour to toggle. In
fact I wanted a kind of unmark_all since I sometimes mark_all by
accident. Then again marking/unmarking of single entries is a toggle
with a single key, so this may be more sensible.

20061102:
Version for Audacious with xmmsalike.py + ctypes instead of
pyxmms. Aim for a general xmms/audacious/bpm version, as the interface
allows this pretty easily. However, I had to hardcode /mnt/cdrom as
the drive mountpoint, since the functions for reading the config are
not so universal. I don't consider this a big issue, but hardcoding is
such a loss of elegance ;)

20061103:

Generalized xmmsalike.py usage to cover xmms and bmp in addition to
audacious. (BMP does need testing though, I don't have it at the
moment.) Also rebuilt the X detection and headless stuff, it may need
some more refining. Since the cdrom directory is no longer detected,
and there are some other variables you need to specify, I put those at
the top of this script for easier configuration.

20061103b:

New config file reading function; now we can again get CDDA directory
from the player :)

20071115:

Audacious 1.4.0 changed API, allows control via dbus, so I modified
Comms to use dbus-python. No C library hacks needed :) At the same
time I removed some obsolete things like the Xvfb parts, and support
for other players like XMMS. The MPRIS interface of Audacious' dbus
interface looks interesting, it should work as a standard remote
interface for multiple players, so you might look into it in the
future.

20071116:

Added negative-time protection for seek()
Updated helptext to reflect the working add_url function, and the
search that's always been there
Changed str() to unicode() that seemed to fix some character-encoding bugs

20071203:

Further Unicode fixes: the fundamental problem wasn't apparently with
str() vs. unicode(), but with the .encode(\"utf8\"). I had previously
added this to some SongTitle fetches but not all. Then I ran into
other problems with unicode(), as some file listings were broken. So
it's back to str() with more systematic utf8 encodings.

20071204:

Brown bag fix for command_chdir_or_play(): The last item of a list has
the index (length - 1), rather than (length + 1).

20080127:

Reorganized the Audacious startup loop, to avoid launching multiple instances

--------------------------------------------------------------

Remaining problems due to Audacious 1.4.0:

CDDA input plugin seems to have changed, I haven't figured out how it
works.

Outright bugs independent of Comms
